The format for running commands is ~<string containing yui> <name of the command> <command arguments>~
The command name list can be accessed via yui help.

- is-mod can only check for one person's id. Moderator role checking is not yet added
- ~yui search~ may go down, because the search providers being used do not have very stable APIs
