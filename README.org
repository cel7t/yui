#+TITLE:yui

A personal Discord bot written in Clojure!

* Usage

Edit the commented parameters in config.edn to begin.
Any string that contains yui, such as "Yui-chan," "yui", "YUI" will invoke her.
The second option has to be a command name.
Command name list can be accessed via yui help.

* Notes
- is-mod can only check for one person's id. Moderator role checking is not yet added, but is trivial you to implement.
- since yui is meant to be run from heroku, files aren't used for dailies/coins. due to this, the process can take several seconds, as it makes use of discord channels to store these values
- make yui say 1 1 in the score channel and 1 1 in the daily channel and pin the message. Yui will now use this message to keep track of the score. I highly recommend using a separate server to store these messages. You can edit out the 1 1s later
- the currency system is currently disabled

* Running
Fill in the required details in config.edn, src/yui/functions.clj and src/yui/core.clj
#+BEGIN_SRC
lein run
#+END_SRC
